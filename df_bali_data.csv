Estas ofrendas se colocan en diferentes lugares de la casa (en la cocina, las escaleras, en el suelo..), en los templos de cada casa , en la calle, delante de la puerta de su tienda, etc, todos ellos con diferentes intenciones (para tener suerte, para evitar peligro, para “conseguir” más ventas…).

The colourful traditional fishing boats that line the coastal. These graceful vessels use only one main cloth sail and in favourable winds can skim them ocean’s surface at a fairly rapid pace. The Balinese generally use jukung for fishing. These boats will venture out into the coastal waters in the evening and return with their catch before sunrise to sell at local seafood markets. However, the impact of tourism has meant that many of the island’s traditional fishermen can now supplement their limited incomes by taking paying passengers to surf and snorkel at offshore reefs and neighbouring islands.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

En plein centre d’Ubud se trouve une foret habitée par les singes. Il s’agit bien de leur foret, ils sont en nombre et font la loi. Ils sont chapardeurs et n'hésitent pas à se servir dans les sacs des touristes ;. Ils peuvent aussi être agressifs si vous les regardez dans les yeux.
La forêt est une des curiosités phares de Ubud.

À proximité du marché traditionnel, et à l'intersection de la Jalan Monkey Forest et Jalan Raya Ubud, se trouve le vaste palais Puri Saren Agung. La maison de Tjokorda Agung Gede Sukawati (1910-1978), dernier &quot;roi&quot; d'Ubud, est maintenant occupée par ses descendants et des spectacles de danse ont lieu dans sa cour.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

Pura Pulé, Mas, on Odalan day (Kuningan)","The gamelan angklung is one of the most popular types of  orchestra in Bali, requiring about twenty musicians. Tuned to a four-tone scale in slendro tuning, the gamelan angklung presents a cheerful, open, and rhythmically intricate musical landscape, expressed in the fluid grace of its traditional repertoire. 
Although gamelan angklung is often heard in the Balinese temple, where it can supply musical accompaniment to a normal odalan (temple anniversary), its most characteristic and identifying context is in rituals related to death, and therefore to the invisible spiritual world of transitions from life to death and beyond.

La maison de Tjokorda Agung Gede Sukawati (1910-1978), dernier &quot;roi&quot; d'Ubud, est maintenant occupée par ses descendants et des spectacles de danse ont lieu dans sa cour.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

La forêt des singes d'Ubud est une réserve naturelle sacrée, située à l'extrémité sud de Jalan Monkey Forest. Elle abrite le temple de Dalem Agung Padantegal et plus de 600 macaques à longue queue (Macaca fascicularis) (en 2016).

À proximité du marché traditionnel, et à l'intersection de la Jalan Monkey Forest et Jalan Raya Ubud, se trouve le vaste palais Puri Saren Agung. La maison de Tjokorda Agung Gede Sukawati (1910-1978), dernier &quot;roi&quot; d'Ubud, est maintenant occupée par ses descendants et des spectacles de danse ont lieu dans sa cour. C'est aussi l'un des premiers hôtels d'Ubud, datant de 1930.","Gianyar Kabupaten","-8.518778","115.257977"

La plage de Nusa Dua est notamment appréciée pour la pratique du kitesurf.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

La forêt des singes d'Ubud est une réserve naturelle sacrée, située à l'extrémité sud de Jalan Monkey Forest. Elle abrite le temple de Dalem Agung Padantegal et plus de 600 macaques à longue queue (Macaca fascicularis) (en 2016).

À proximité du marché traditionnel, et à l'intersection de la Jalan Monkey Forest et Jalan Raya Ubud, se trouve le vaste palais Puri Saren Agung. La maison de Tjokorda Agung Gede Sukawati (1910-1978), dernier &quot;roi&quot; d'Ubud, est maintenant occupée par ses descendants et des spectacles de danse ont lieu dans sa cour.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

L'endroit abrite de nombreux lieux touristiques liés à son littoral de calcaire corallien, tels Jimbaran Beach et Garuda Wisnu Kencana. Les premiers investissements sur le site ont débuté en 1973 avec l'aide la Banque mondiale.

La plage de Nusa Dua est notamment appréciée pour la pratique du kitesurf.

Elle est le lieu où se tient en décembre 2007 la conférence de Bali consacrée aux problèmes des changements climatiques mondiaux.","Badung Kabupaten","-8.795787","115.232605"

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

À proximité du marché traditionnel, et à l'intersection de la Jalan Monkey Forest et Jalan Raya Ubud, se trouve le vaste palais Puri Saren Agung.

Barong wears a wooden mask like a large animal head ,beautifully carved and brightly coloured in red, white, black and gold. It is topped by a crown extending outwards to the sides of the head. The widow-witch Rangda is the queen of death and devourer of children. She practices the destructive forces of black magic and all things evil. Her mask is dark and fore boding, with a protruding red and gold tongue of fire. Of course Barong always triumphs over evil Rangda and saves all the unfortunate beings from stabbing themselves to death!

L'endroit abrite de nombreux lieux touristiques liés à son littoral de calcaire corallien, tels Jimbaran Beach et Garuda Wisnu Kencana. Les premiers investissements sur le site ont débuté en 1973 avec l'aide la Banque mondiale.

La plage de Nusa Dua est notamment appréciée pour la pratique du kitesurf.

Elle est le lieu où se tient en décembre 2007 la conférence de Bali consacrée aux problèmes des changements climatiques mondiaux.","Badung Kabupaten","-8.796578","115.232863"

Riding onto the rutted, muddy tracks between the rice paddies was an opportunity to get up close and watch the arduous job of transplanting rice seedlings into the larger rice field.

This architectural feature is commonly found in buildings from the classical Hindu-Buddhist period of Indonesia. Paduraksa marks the threshold into the most sacred space (the inner sanctum) within a religious compound, a cemetery, or a palace. In Balinese architecture, an elaborately decorated towering paduraksa is often built as the temple's most imposing structure.

While the basic form of a paduraksa is of a stepped candi, it can be heavily decorated with ornaments, figures, and symbols. In Bali, the crown of the paduraksa is decorated with flame-like ornaments and celestial figures. The menacing head of the bhoma or fierce kala is often carved over the opening, while a lion-like effigies, or a pair of fierce giants of dvarapalas, guard the sides of the entrance. Both menacing figures of kala's head and dvarapalas door guardians, are believed to have protective property; to repel and drive away evil spirits from entering the compound.

The main kori that marks the threshold into the inner sanctum of the main shrine is known as the kori agung (&quot;great kori&quot;). A paduraksa in the Islamic cemetery complex of Sendang Duwur contains a mysterious wing-like feature thought to represent the wings of the meru; this might be associated with the celestial bird garuda [Wikipedia.org]","Badung Kabupaten","-8.694093","115.168742"

This architectural feature is commonly found in buildings from the classical Hindu-Buddhist period of Indonesia. Paduraksa marks the threshold into the most sacred space (the inner sanctum) within a religious compound, a cemetery, or a palace. In Balinese architecture, an elaborately decorated towering paduraksa is often built as the temple's most imposing structure.

While the basic form of a paduraksa is of a stepped candi, it can be heavily decorated with ornaments, figures, and symbols. In Bali, the crown of the paduraksa is decorated with flame-like ornaments and celestial figures. The menacing head of the bhoma or fierce kala is often carved over the opening, while a lion-like effigies, or a pair of fierce giants of dvarapalas, guard the sides of the entrance. Both menacing figures of kala's head and dvarapalas door guardians, are believed to have protective property; to repel and drive away evil spirits from entering the compound.

The main kori that marks the threshold into the inner sanctum of the main shrine is known as the kori agung (&quot;great kori&quot;). A paduraksa in the Islamic cemetery complex of Sendang Duwur contains a mysterious wing-like feature thought to represent the wings of the meru; this might be associated with the celestial bird garuda [Wikipedia.org]","Badung Kabupaten","-8.694093","115.168742"

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

<b>The greatest</b> thing I can say about Canggu is that the gentrification process seems to have weeded out all classic tourist traps (shops hawking t-shirts with funny prints, etc) in favour of high-end eateries and small boutique shops. So the food is great but my feeling was a little bit like I could've been anywhere in the world, which to me is a bit sad.

Both the adult male and female have similar appearance; they primarily have a golden-yellow plumage with orange-flushed underparts and face. They can grow up to 30 cm (12 in) long and typically weighs about 110g (4 oz). 

These birds normally feed on seeds, nuts, fruits, flowers, and insects. Unfortunately, in the wild, they are currently threatened by loss of habitat and trapping for their plumage or the pet trade and have been  listed as endangered by the IUCN.

Escuchar y mirar miles de litros de agua que caen en cascada a más 50 metros de altura a una hermosa piscina, no tiene precio.

Suena precioso? Sin embargo, llegar allí es un verdadero desafío. Situado en la parte inferior de un desfiladero, hay que descender hasta 509 escalones para llegar a las cataratas. Pero ser recibido con una magnífica vista de las cascadas, sin duda es una imagen perfecta y merece la pena. 

Después de las fotos de rigor, toca un bañito, en esas agua cristalinas para reponer fuerzas, ya que ahora viene lo peor...subir los 509 escalones!! Pero bueno como podéis ver en la foto, la experiencia mereció la pena.

It is known internationally for its long sandy beach, varied accommodation, many restaurants and bars, and many renowned surfers who visit from Australia. It is located near Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport.

The beach has been notable since early 1970s. Kuta beach is also known as Sunset Beach, as opposed to the Sunrise Beach, another name for Sanur Beach. Luxury resorts, restaurants, and clubs are located along the beach.","Badung Kabupaten","-8.720681","115.169694"

This is a Bali Aga village, inhabited by descendants of the original Balinese, the people who predate the arrival of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. It is famous for the Pura Pancering Jagat temple, but unfortunately visitors are not allowed inside. There are also a couple of traditional Bali Aga-style dwellings, and a large banyan tree, which is said to be more than 1,100 years old. At Kuban sub-village close to Trunyan is a mysterious cemetery that is separated by the lake and accessible only by boat - there is no path along the steep walls of the crater rim.

The village of Trunyan itself is situated at the edge of Batur Lake. This location is inaccessible except by boat, and it takes around half an hour across the calm waters. Getting to Lake Batur takes around two hours drive to the northeast of Denpasar along the main road to Buleleng and through Bangli Regency.

Unlike the Balinese people, the people of Trunyan do not cremate or bury their dead, but just lay them out in bamboo cages to decompose, although strangely there is no stench. A macabre collection of skulls and bones lies on the stone platform and the surrounding areas.

The dead bodies don't produce bad smells because of the perfumed scents from a huge Taru Menyan tree growing nearby. Taru means 'tree' and Menyan means 'nice smell'. The name of Terunyan was also derived from these two words.

The women from Trunyan are prohibited from going to the cemetery when a dead body is carried there. This follows the deeply rooted belief that if a woman comes to the cemetery while a corpse is being carried there, there will be a disaster in the village, for example a landslide or a volcanic eruption. Such events have been frequent in the village's history, but whether women had anything to do with it is a matter of opinion...

You can visit both the village of Trunyan and the Kuban cemetery by chartered boat from Kedisan. Sadly, nowadays the boat trips are now blatant tourist traps, as touts and guides strongly urge you to donate your cash to the temple project or leave a donation for the dead. These touts ruin an otherwise fascinating experience.

It is 4 years since the last Kedisan cremation and virtually all the villagers returned to Kedisan for the 10 days of Balinese Hindu rituals. Over 1000 people joined the final day of ceremonies, a pilgrimage to East Bali for scattering of ashes at the beach , a picnic lunch and a special ceremony at Pura Goa Lawah for babies who died through miscarriage. From there the final leg of the journey was to the mother temple of Bali, Pura Besakih.","Karang Asem","-8.374481","115.451273"

It's time to show a picture from my trip to Bali,  Indonesia.
This beautiful jetty is located at the Naya Gawana Resort in the northwest part of Bali. You can see some volcanoes at the island Java from there. Java is very close to Bali.

Our first hotel in Kubu had to be evacuated because of the volcanic activity at Mt. Agung...
We were very lucky that we stayed in safety of this mountain :))

The last day of the Kedisan celebrations for the mass cremation of 55 people. It is 4 years since the last Kedisan cremation and virtually all the villagers returned to Kedisan for the 10 days of Balinese Hindu rituals. Over 1000 people joined the final day of ceremonies, a pilgrimage to East Bali for scattering of ashes at the beach , a picnic lunch and a special ceremony at Pura Goa Lawah for babies who died through miscarriage. From there the final leg of the journey was to the mother temple of Bali, Pura Besakih.","Karang Asem","-8.374481","115.451273"

Once again we were left on our own for the evening so we decided to go for a stroll. I couldn't stop myself from shooting this amazing looking volcano, the second highest mountain in Bali. The last time it erupted was in 1963, killing about 1500 people and destroying multiple villages.","Karang Asem","-8.284982","115.590097"

Most people keep the meaning the expensive coffee is the product of cats but this is absolute an hooey. Cats never eat coffee cherries, cats eat fish and meat.
The Luwak is an animal like a weasel or the Asian palm civet - never a cat!
Here I post my photo captured in Bali Pulina a famouse Coffee plantage nearby Ubud.
(Its very difficult to get the Luwak in front of the camera in the wild, the animal moving very fast and seen only at night. But its reprehensible too to keep the animals in cages just for making business with the most expensive coffee.)","Gianyar Kabupaten","-8.422631","115.278750"

It is known internationally for its long sandy beach, varied accommodation, many restaurants and bars, and many renowned surfers who visit from Australia. It is located near Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport.

The beach has been notable since early 1970s. Kuta beach is also known as Sunset Beach, as opposed to the Sunrise Beach, another name for Sanur Beach. Luxury resorts, restaurants, and clubs are located along the beach.","Badung Kabupaten","-8.720414","115.169144"

Bonnie was apparently a &quot;nuisance&quot; at the Villa where she was from, the customers complained. She was dumped for others to take care of which did not really occur, how many dogs survive on a bit of rice?

 Eventually the western owner did not return and my partner was taking care of her, feeding her. Soon, there were complaints at her accommodation where Bonnie had been dumped. The owner decided that Bonnie would be taken away and either dumped or killed. We stepped in and saved her.

Bonnie (not her original name) lives with us and although she has her anxiety issues she is much happier, healthier and relaxed than she was living the life of a stray. Bonnie is very sophisticated too, loving classical music and opera. She's also a fussy eater and prefers fresh ayam goreng (fried chicken) over anything else.

We love our dog and she never needs to fear ever being dumped again.","Gianyar Kabupaten","-8.486994","115.270292"

Kopi luwak or civet coffee is a coffee made from the beans of coffee berries which have been eaten by the Asian Palm Civet and other related civets, then passed through its digestive tract.
A civet eats the berries for their fleshy pulp. In its stomach, proteolytic enzymes seep into the beans, making shorter peptides and more free amino acids. Passing through a civet's intestines the beans are then defecated, keeping their shape. After gathering, thorough washing, sun drying, light roasting and brewing, these beans yield an aromatic coffee with much less bitterness, widely noted as the most expensive coffee in the world.
The boy is roasting fresh beans for preparing a cup of coffee for us.","Gianyar Kabupaten","-8.422631","115.278538"

The colourful traditional fishing boats that line the coastal. These graceful vessels use only one main cloth sail and in favourable winds can skim them ocean’s surface at a fairly rapid pace. The Balinese generally use jukung for fishing. These boats will venture out into the coastal waters in the evening and return with their catch before sunrise to sell at local seafood markets. However, the impact of tourism has meant that many of the island’s traditional fishermen can now supplement their limited incomes by taking paying passengers to surf and snorkel at offshore reefs and neighbouring islands.

The last day of the Kedisan celebrations for the mass cremation of 55 people. It is 4 years since the last Kedisan cremation and virtually all the villagers returned to Kedisan for the 10 days of Balinese Hindu rituals. Over 1000 people joined the final day of ceremonies, a pilgrimage to East Bali for scattering of ashes at the beach , a picnic lunch and a special ceremony at Pura Goa Lawah for babies who died through miscarriage. From there the final leg of the journey was to the mother temple of Bali, Pura Besakih.","Karang Asem","-8.374481","115.451273"

Mads Lange Memorial, Kuta, Bali, Indonesia","One of the reasons I made a stop-over of more than a day on Bali this time was to visit the relatively little know  memorial to a hero of mine, Mads Johansen Lange (1807-1856). Lange was an adventurous entrepreneur who shipped out of Denmark at age 14; after sailing to Tharangambadi - then the Danish colony Tranquebar - in the Indian Tamil Nadu, he cultivated a taste for the East. With his brothers he set out for Southeast Asia, and he was a merchant at Tanjungkarang near Ampenan and Mataram on Lombok in 1835. Lange became heavily involved in local politics between two Balinese rajahs there and also the Sasak population. Soon forced to flee to Bali (1839) by the skin of his teeth he made good there becoming outstandingly rich. Lange traded in spices, green tobacco, rice, cows and much more. A great share of this wealth he accrued by selling dried beef to the Dutch colonial troops on Java. He managed to hold his own in the highly changeable politics of Bali and the three Dutch armed expeditionary wars there. In fact, Lange was something of a peace broker, and in time was called 'the king of Bali'. Awarded a knighthood in the Netherlands Lion by King William III, he increasingly went his own way and became a thorn in the side of the Dutch. Rumor had it that Lange was gotten rid of by poisoning. 
Regardless, he was not forgotten. His warehouses were on the banks of the Tukad Mati (=Dead River, because it no longer has any function) of Kuta which merchant vessels could still navigate in Lange's times. Here he was buried. 
In 1927, the Dutch erected a small memorial on his grave; this was 'cleaned up' and enlarged by his descendants in 1996-1997; finally in 2007, a great restoration took place financed by family members from Denmark, Brazil, Singapore and Johor. Perhaps most notable in this is that the Sultans of Johor are proud of Lange as their ancestor. Lange's daughter Cecilia, taking the name of Zubaidah, had  married  Sultan Abu Bakar (1833-1895) in 1862; their son is the direct ancestor of the present Sultan. The latter's name figures prominently on the list of donors engraved on this memorial.
The inset photo is of Lange's bust next to the memorial. It was sculpted by Lars Calmar (1968-) of Rudkøbing, Denmark. The entire memorial is exceptionally well-kept and clean, and very well worth a visit even though it's a bit out of the way.","Badung Kabupaten","-8.728406","115.179013"

The colourful traditional fishing boats that line the coastal. These graceful vessels use only one main cloth sail and in favourable winds can skim them ocean’s surface at a fairly rapid pace. The Balinese generally use jukung for fishing. These boats will venture out into the coastal waters in the evening and return with their catch before sunrise to sell at local seafood markets. However, the impact of tourism has meant that many of the island’s traditional fishermen can now supplement their limited incomes by taking paying passengers to surf and snorkel at offshore reefs and neighbouring islands.

Though it may not look like it, here, dogs in Bali seemed to be less domesticated than dogs in the US and France. They, also, tended not to be fenced in and really could defend their properties; I was followed, a few times, to make sure  I had gone on my way. ","Gianyar Kabupaten","-8.506689","115.245605"

prácticamente todo el sudeste asiático, ocupando tanto entornos urbanos como
naturales. Son unos de los primates con
mayor capacidad de adaptación.

Por lo visto esta especie se emplea en estudios médicos. Después que se puso restricciones en la exportación del Macaco Rhesus , el Macaco Cangrejero lo ha sustituido en muchos estudios. En la isla Tinjil, en Indonesia, se ha creado una colonia con el propósito de criarlos para estos fines.

El Macaco Cangrejero es principalmente de hábitos arborícolas. Durante el día es muy probable que se mantenga dentro de la vegetación. Por la mañana y por la tarde, al menos algunas poblaciones, visitan la orilla del río u otro depósito de agua...(de hay lo de Macaco cangrejero)

Este mono es un excelente nadador. Se sumerge bajo la superficie y nada en busca de alimentos que se encuentran en el fondo, los cuales, tan pronto los obtiene, regresa a la orilla.

La longitud que llegan a alcanzar estos animales esta entre 38 y 64 cm, la longitud de su cola oscila entre los 40 y los 65 cm, suelen ser de mayor tamaño los machos. con el peso pasa lo mismo, de media, las hembras suelen pesar sobre los 4 kg, mientras el macho lo hace sobre los7 kg.

The last day of the Kedisan celebrations for the mass cremation of 55 people. It is 4 years since the last Kedisan cremation and virtually all the villagers returned to Kedisan for the 10 days of Balinese Hindu rituals. Over 1000 people joined the final day of ceremonies, a pilgrimage to East Bali for scattering of ashes at the beach , a picnic lunch and a special ceremony at Pura Goa Lawah for babies who died through miscarriage. From there the final leg of the journey was to the mother temple of Bali, Pura Besakih.","Karang Asem","-8.374481","115.451273"

Construido en el siglo XVII sobre el lago Bratan, el segundo más grande de la isla, Ulan Danu está dedicado a Dewi Danu, diosa del agua, y es lugar de peregrinación sobre todo de campesinos, que acuden a él a pedir agua para sus cultivos.

Su importancia al proteger la principal fuente de irrigación de la zona es por tanto innegable, pero además, como podemos observar en la fotografía, su aspecto no puede ser más hermoso y elegante.

El lago Bratan, formado en el cráter del antiguo volcán Mount Catur, se encuentra a unos 1.200 metros de altitud, rodeado de verdes montañas y cubierto por una suave neblina. Todo ello, en conjunto, compone una estampa de ensueño. No por nada, esta imagen decora los billetes de 50.000 rupias.","Buleleng Kabupaten","-8.274869","115.166534"

It was not easy to get a model in Bali. The original model that I was in contact with while I was still in Montreal, was very slow in responding to my emails and I felt very uncertain that she will follow through. I absolutely wanted to do at least one session with one model during my Bali visit. Out of the 23 days in Bali, it would seem unlikely not to be able to book a model for even a single session. Well it turns out that the casting sites that I use for booking models are blocked in Indonesia due to their nudity content. Indonesia is a very religious country with strict morality laws on nudity. Luckily while still in Montreal, I cast a wider net than I really needed by contacting as many as 5 models. As it turned out one of them named Hanie was able to respond, and with the help of my friend Paul Saulnier, a Montreal expat photographer, we were able to set us the session. I hope that in the next little while you will be seeing a whole lot of Hanie. 

Tomorrow I will be doing the 24hr flight back to Montreal, so this will be my last posting for a bit.

For my video patrons, the session with Hanie was filmed and I will eventually use some of the footage in my upcoming videos.

<b>Great photography requires dedication,</b> time and effort. 
But above all there are costs involved as well. 
Equipment, props and model fees, not to mention time, 
are all &quot;out-of-pocket&quot; expenses for the artist. 

If you enjoy my photographic art, you might like to help to support it.

It is said to protect and bring luck. They are made by hand, everyday, and are often beautifully detailed.
